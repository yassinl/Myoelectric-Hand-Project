## Current Status
IN PROGRESS 
(Research/Early Prototyping)

## Project Overview

Designing and Building a Low Cost Myoelectric Hand. 
This Electronic Prosthetic Device is aimed to provide an affordable solution for amputees. Hand interfaces non-invasively with EMG probes on the forearm flexor muscle. Machine learning models will be implemented to increase reliability since EMG signals on their own tend to be unreliable.  

## Educational Value Added

This project allows for me to develop my problem solving skills in developing a practical client facing medical device. By the end of the project I will have developed a deepened understanding and practical understanding of signal acquisition, processing, Machine Learning, Motor Drivers, Mechanical Design, and Circuit Fundamentals.  

## Tasks

choosing what parts are going to drive the hand 
- motors we're going to use to drive the fingers and wrist 
- motor drivers we're going to use  
- PCB Design for creating compact circuits for power and signal distribution
- creating a reliable solution for acquiring and interpreting EMG Signals 
- Designing the machine learning model thats going to increase the reliability of the machine learning model

## Design Decisions

- Motors 
We spent a lot of time prototyping with servo motors but we realized early on that we weren't getting enough torque out of them.
We're going to opt for more powerful micro dc motors to handle the demands of real world use--these are slightly more difficult
to interface with but provide better torque to volume ratio. 

- Joint Materials
So far the fingers are held together by a combination of fishing line and thinely printed TPU
likely this won't look exactly like the final design these materials aren't incredibly sustainable and 
we want our hand to be wearable for longer than a year despite the low budget

## Steps for Documenting Your Design Process

So far my team uploads their documentation and collaborations via microsoft teams. 
We also plan meetings on groupme. 
- so far I keep notes accross a personal github repository
- as I get further in the design proces I'll publish more refined documentation including:
- kicad schematics
- engineering notebooks 
- technical drawings

## BOM + Component Cost (<$200)

- Micro DC Motors x 5 (~$35 total, $7 each)
- Micro DC Motor Drivers x 5 (~$25 total, $5 each)
- Servo motors x 5 (~$25 total, $5 each)
- Gravity EMG Sensor x 1 (~$40)
- Conductive Gel (~$15)
- Fishing Line 1 spool (~$5)
- Custom PCBs x 2 ($10 total, $5 each)

Total Estimated Cost: ~$155

note:
-  the grand majority of the project is funded through SEC
- AMP lab purchase requests would only be used for supplemental parts orders to
expedite the prototyping process


## Timeline

- This is a several semester long project 
- Not something that one person could get done on their own own in a short amount of time. 
- with the help of Amp Lab we can have a working prototype by the end of semester and a more polished version by the end of next semester.
- we are also working to get a client on the project so this can be a senior capstone project
